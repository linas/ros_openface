# ros_openface
ROS wrapper for CMU's OpenFace face recognition system

OpenFace is Carnegie-Mellon's face recognition system. The describe themselse 
as a "free and open source face recognition with deep neural networks." See
https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface for details.

ROS is the Robot Operating system. The code here is a thin wrapper exposing
OpenFace as a ROS node.  Similar projects include
https://github.com/ditoec/openface2_ros
and
https://github.com/interaction-lab/openface_ros
both of which contain more features and better documentation than this repo does.
See also https://github.com/tue-robotics/image_recognition
for a collection of face recognition and body-pose ROS wrappers.

## Status
As of 2018, this system has been used, from time to time, in various Hanson
Robotics demos.
